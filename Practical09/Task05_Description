/*         ***********************difference between struct and class*********************************
   1. access specifier :-a structure is a class defined with struct keyword and access specifier 
   is by default public where as when class is derived access specifier is by defalut private.
   2. security :- data members in class are private the concept of data hiding because 
   we cannot acess data members directly ,on the other 
   hand data members of structure are public by default which shows a lack of security in using structure.
   3.structure is a value type data type and class is a refrence type data type instances of stack are stored 
   in stack where in class instances are stored in heap as the references of object are stored in heap.
   4.inheritance :- structure cannot inherit other structures or classes w
   here as class can inherit other classes ans struct.
